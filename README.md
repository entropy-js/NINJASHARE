# NINJASHARE

##NINJASHARE Membership Club

NINJASHARE is a profit sharing asset on the Pepe Ninja bankroll. Holders enjoy nightly PEPECASH
dividends of 40% from all plays on that day, issued at 11 PM EST and finished no later than 12 AM EST.

The token will enter ICO phase on 9 A.M, Janurary 21 EST and will be initially 1000 shares
for 1000 PEPECASH each. The shares will be offered on the DEX in individual lots of 100 NINJASHARE. The first lot
will be purchased by @beartree, establishing his initial stake. The remainder will be available to all interested parties.

Pepe Ninja reserves the right to issue 1000 new shares each month, subject to a revaluation of Pepe Ninja, 
and offered at the evaluation price via the DEX. Once 10,000 NINJASHARE have been issued, the token will be locked from further issuance.
Members are free to resale and offer their NINJASHARE on the open market at any time.

Members can offer suggestions, report errors and bugs, and suggest new games. Additionally, a bot will be released that
allows the download of a certificate of NINJASHARE membership. This feature allows you to show your NINJASHARE membership to others, 
and may be used as perks in real world locations in the future.

All proceeds from the ICO go directly to the Pepe Ninja jackpot!
Happy gaming!
